The C raytracer that outputs things nicer than Vaportrace

This project attempts to provide a modern solution to the problem of creating retro raytraced imagery. Instead of digging up and running some program under virtual box you'd run this and be able to use things like .gltf/.glb scenes. 

### Why C? C++ worked just fine for Vaportr-
Hahahahah. I write C99 nowadays for these kinds of projects. It's simple. To the point. Maximum velocity iteration! And other claims I made up!

#### Current Feature List
* Panorama image sky (thanks, sphere mapping!)

#### TODO
* Shove that panorama code somewhere more uniform!
* Triangle intersection
* Model data structure (add tinygltf dependency)
* Directional & Point lights
* Full Phong Shading
* Reflection & Refraction
* Full Distributed RT Implementation (not the "run on multiple computers" kind)
